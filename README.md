# CS-US spell checker for Firefox

Combines [cs](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/czech-spell-checking-dictionar/) and [en-US](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/united-states-english-spellche/) dictionaries to avoid dictionary switching when writing frequently in both Czech and English languages.

How to use:

 1. Download this repo
 2. Put in `YOUR_FIREFOX_PROFILE\extensions\cs-en@dictionaries.addons.mozilla.org`
 3. Restart Firefox
 4. Make sure this dictionary is enabled in *Add-ons > Dictionaries*
 5. Choose **Czech (EN)** dictionary when spell-checking

Optionally, you may completely disable / uninstall the `cs` and `en-US` dictionaries. To uninstall the pre-installed one (en-US in my case as I installed en-US Firefox), go to [Firefox installation directory](http://kb.mozillazine.org/Installation_directory)`/dictionaries` and remove (or rename to be safe) the files there.

Enjoy!
